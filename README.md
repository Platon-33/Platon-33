- 👋 Hi, I’m @Platon-33
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development, Catholic theology, Western Philosophy, essay writting and playing wonderful games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Liberal Arts in Wyoming, USA. I am teaching myself how to build games in Unity and how to be comfortable in C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular atm. If we've talked before, then disregard. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have spent over a year in the wilderness since starting college.
